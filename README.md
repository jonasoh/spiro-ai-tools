# SPIRO Data AI Training Tools

This repository contains code for processing and preparing data from [SPIRO](https://github.com/jonasoh/spiro) - a plant phenotyping platform that captures time-lapse images of seeds growing in Petri plates - for use in AI model training.

## Purpose

The code here helps transform SPIRO-generated images into suitable training data for machine learning models, enabling AI-based analysis of plant growth patterns.

## Development Note

This project was developed primarily using AI-assisted programming tools as part of a course evaluation of AI pair programming capabilities. It serves as both a practical tool and a case study in AI-assisted development.
